CYCLONE PREDICTOR FOR THE INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT

IDEA: 
	 The idea that lead to this mini-project was how effective will K-Means Clustering be to classify and find out the severity of an upcoming Tropical Cyclone when fed satellite images. An accurate system which can tag the severity of the cyclone using close to real-time satellite images will lead to better response and relief to the impacted areas.
Focusing our efforts to the Indian-subcontinent to improve the results by cropping out the data provided by the HURSAT to our specifics for this mini-project.
We plan to achieve K-Means clustering by grey-scaling the different stages of each cyclone and giving it a score based on its severity.   This data becomes extremely useful as it becomes a measure to find the distance(likeliness) of the test sample to our data and hence forming a cluster.
The movement of the sample data through different clusters gives us a fair idea on how the cyclone is going to develop, which area is under threat and hence a chance for us to help save both life and property.
