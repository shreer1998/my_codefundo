CYCLONE PREDICTOR FOR THE INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT

IDEA: 
	 The idea that led to this mini-project was how effective will CNN (Convolutional neural network) be to classify and find out the severity of an upcoming Tropical Cyclone when fed satellite images. An accurate system which can tag the severity of the cyclone using close to real-time satellite images will lead to better response and relief to the impacted areas.
Focusing our efforts to the Indian-subcontinent to improve the results by cropping out the data provided by the BHUVAN satellite to our specifics for this mini-project.
We plan to convolve through three main features that will help us single out a cyclone from other natural disasters namely:
	1.Sea Level Pressure
	2.Wind Curl(Speed)
	3.Temperature

The above information along with modest domain knowledge will give us a fair idea on how the cyclone is going to develop, which area is under threat and hence a chance for us to help save both life and property.

The final application will be working with live satellite images.
